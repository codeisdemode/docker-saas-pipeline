# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for our Docker-based SaaS application. The pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys Docker containers from development to AWS EC2 instances for each customer.

## Pipeline Overview

![CI/CD Pipeline Overview](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=CI/CD+Pipeline+Diagram)

Our CI/CD pipeline follows industry best practices for SaaS development, ensuring consistent and reliable deployments for each customer while maintaining isolation.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Code Commit & Pull Request

- Developers commit code to feature branches
- Pull Requests are created for code review
- Automated linting and formatting checks are triggered

### 2. Continuous Integration

- Automated tests are run on pull request
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - End-to-end tests
- Code quality checks with SonarQube
- Security scanning with Snyk

### 3. Build & Package

- Docker image is built from source code
- Image is tagged with:
  - Git commit hash
  - Build number
  - Environment (dev, staging, prod)
- Image metadata is added for traceability

### 4. Registry Storage

- Built images are pushed to Amazon ECR
- Images are scanned for vulnerabilities
- Image signatures are verified

### 5. Deployment Preparation

- Customer-specific configuration is generated
- Database migrations are prepared
- Deployment manifests are created

### 6. Deployment

- Customer-specific containers are deployed to EC2 instances
- Blue/Green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
- Health checks confirm successful deployment
- Traffic is gradually shifted to new deployment

### 7. Monitoring & Validation

- Automated smoke tests run against new deployment
- Performance metrics are collected
- Alerts are configured for anomalies
- Deployment is marked as successful

## GitHub Actions Workflow

We use GitHub Actions to automate our CI/CD pipeline. Here's a sample workflow configuration:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build --exit-code-from tests
          
  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-west-2
          
      - name: Login to Amazon ECR
        id: login-ecr
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1
        
      - name: Build, tag, and push image to Amazon ECR
        env:
          ECR_REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
          ECR_REPOSITORY: saas-app
          IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}
        run: |
          docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:latest .
          docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
          docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:latest
          
  deploy:
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-west-2
          
      - name: Deploy to customers
        run: |
          # Run deployment script for each customer
          ./scripts/deploy-to-customers.sh
```

## Customer-Specific Deployment

Our deployment strategy ensures that each customer gets their own isolated environment:

1. Customer-specific EC2 instances are provisioned using Terraform
2. Each customer has a dedicated database schema
3. Customer configuration is injected as environment variables
4. Containers are tagged with customer identifier
5. Routing is configured to direct customer traffic to their specific container

## Multi-Stage Deployment

We use a multi-stage deployment approach:

1. **Development**: Automatic deployment to development environment
2. **Staging**: Manual approval required for staging environment
3. **Production**: Manual approval required for production environment

## Infrastructure as Code

All infrastructure is managed through Terraform:

- EC2 instances
- VPC and security groups
- Load balancers
- Auto-scaling groups
- IAM roles and policies

## Rollback Strategy

In case of deployment issues:

1. Automated health checks detect failures
2. Traffic is automatically reverted to previous version
3. Alerts are sent to the DevOps team
4. Logs are collected for diagnostics
5. Post-mortem analysis is conducted

## Security Considerations

Our CI/CD pipeline includes several security measures:

1. Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager
2. Least privilege IAM roles
3. Image vulnerability scanning
4. Infrastructure security scanning
5. Compliance checking
6. Audit logging

## Monitoring and Observability

Each deployment is monitored for:

1. Application performance
2. Infrastructure metrics
3. Error rates
4. User experience metrics
5. Business KPIs

## Best Practices

Our CI/CD pipeline follows these best practices:

1. **Automation**: Everything is automated to reduce human error
2. **Immutability**: Containers are immutable and rebuillt for each change
3. **Idempotency**: Deployment scripts can be run multiple times safely
4. **Isolation**: Each customer environment is isolated
5. **Consistency**: Same process for all environments
6. **Traceability**: Every deployment is traceable to a git commit
7. **Testability**: Every change is thoroughly tested

## Setting Up the Pipeline

1. Set up GitHub repository secrets:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - Other environment-specific secrets

2. Create AWS resources:
   - ECR repository
   - IAM roles
   - EC2 instances

3. Configure GitHub Actions workflow

4. Set up monitoring and alerting

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Failed builds**: Check test logs and code quality reports
2. **Deployment failures**: Check EC2 instance logs and health checks
3. **Performance issues**: Review monitoring data and scale resources if needed
4. **Security alerts**: Address vulnerabilities promptly

## Conclusion

This CI/CD pipeline provides a robust, secure, and scalable solution for deploying our Docker-based SaaS application to customer-specific EC2 instances on AWS. It follows best practices for modern SaaS development and operations.
