# Project Planning

This document outlines the planning and roadmap for our Docker SaaS application with CI/CD pipeline to AWS EC2.

## Current Phase: Infrastructure Setup

### Objectives

- [x] Initialize repository structure
- [ ] Set up Docker development environment
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Set up AWS infrastructure with Terraform
- [ ] Implement customer-specific container deployment

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Development Environment (Week 1-2)

- [x] Create project documentation
- [ ] Set up basic application structure
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for development
- [ ] Configure docker-compose for local development
- [ ] Implement local development workflows

### Phase 2: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (Week 3-4)

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Configure testing in CI pipeline
- [ ] Set up Amazon ECR repository
- [ ] Configure image building and tagging
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Set up security scanning

### Phase 3: AWS Infrastructure (Week 5-6)

- [ ] Create Terraform configuration for AWS resources
- [ ] Set up VPC and security groups
- [ ] Configure EC2 instances for container hosting
- [ ] Implement container orchestration
- [ ] Create customer-specific deployment strategy

### Phase 4: Multi-tenant Architecture (Week 7-8)

- [ ] Implement customer isolation
- [ ] Configure tenant-specific routing
- [ ] Set up customer-specific data storage
- [ ] Implement tenant configuration system
- [ ] Create customer onboarding process

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Optimization (Week 9-10)

- [ ] Integrate monitoring and logging
- [ ] Implement alerting
- [ ] Configure performance metrics
- [ ] Set up backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Optimize deployment process

## Technology Stack

- **Container**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Registry**: Amazon ECR
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Prometheus
- **Load Balancing**: AWS Application Load Balancer
- **Database**: RDS (PostgreSQL)

## Implementation Details

### CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions triggers CI pipeline
3. Code is tested and linted
4. Docker image is built
5. Image is tagged with build number and commit hash
6. Image is pushed to Amazon ECR
7. Deployment is triggered for affected customers
8. Customer-specific containers are updated on EC2
9. Monitoring confirms successful deployment

### Customer Isolation Strategy

Each customer will have:
- Dedicated EC2 instance or container
- Isolated database schema
- Separate configuration
- Custom domain routing

## Open Questions & Decisions

- [ ] Should we use ECS/EKS instead of plain EC2?
- [ ] How to handle database migrations for customer-specific instances?
- [ ] What's the scaling strategy for high-traffic customers?
- [ ] How to implement cost-effective backup strategy?

## Next Steps

1. Complete Docker development environment setup
2. Begin GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configuration
3. Create Terraform scripts for AWS infrastructure
4. Implement customer-specific deployment logic
